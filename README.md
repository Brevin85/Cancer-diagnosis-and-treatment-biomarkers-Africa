# Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Biomarkers, Africa
Welcome to our database!

A database that highlights the various cancer biomarkers identified in various African Populations that can be used for both diagnosis and treatment purposes

# Background
The current problem is the lack of a database for cancer diagnosis and treatment response biomarkers specifically for the African population. To address this, we propose creating a comprehensive repository dedicated to these biomarkers. Our unique value proposition is centred on providing access to both recently published and unpublished data for precise cancer diagnoses, this will empower users to easily access and interpret vital information for cancer research purposes. Success will be measured by the number of individuals utilizing the database, which will serve a diverse audience, including healthcare providers, researchers, patients, and their families. One of the most exciting aspects of our project is the collaboration among individuals from varied backgrounds and expertise. To achieve our goals, we require resources such as a website, a GitHub repository, GitHub Pages, a Google Form for data collection, and financial support for operations and publicity. Our contributors will include oncologists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians, molecular biologists, clinical research coordinators, patient advocates, laboratory technicians, data scientists, ethicists, and health economists. Engagement with contributors will occur through Google Forms, emails, our website, and GitHub Pages. This open canvas outlines a strategic approach to bridge the critical gap in cancer biomarker data for the African population, fostering collaboration and innovation in cancer care.
