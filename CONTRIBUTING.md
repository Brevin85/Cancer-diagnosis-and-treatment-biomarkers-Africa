# Good First Bugs for the Contributors

For the Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Biomarkers Project, new contributors are encouraged to start with "Good First Bugs," which are small, manageable, and meaningful tasks that facilitate a smooth entry into the project. These tasks include reviewing the README file for clarity and completeness, reporting issues such as broken links or unclear instructions, and making simple code fixes like correcting minor syntax errors. Contributors can also assist by testing existing features and providing feedback on usability, as well as engaging with the community through discussions and support.

# How to Report a Bug. 

We encourage all contributors to stay vigilant for any potential issues that might affect the Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Biomarkers Project. Here’s how you can report a bug effectively:

 ## 1 Identify the Issue: 
  Look out for problems in the code, content omissions, copy errors, or any functionality or design issues. If something doesn’t seem right, it’s worth noting.
 ## 2 Gather Information:
  * Before reporting, try to collect relevant details about the issue:
  * Describe the problem clearly
  * Include steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
  * Provide any error messages or screenshots that might help illustrate the problem.
## 3 Use the Reporting Template:
  If your project has a specific template for reporting bugs, make sure to use it. This helps maintain consistency and ensures that all necessary information is included.
## 4 Submit Your Report:
  * If you’re using GitHub, navigate to the "Issues" tab of the repository.
  * Click on "New Issue" and fill out the template with the details you gathered.
