Please introduce yourself and share your interests—connecting with each other helps foster a collaborative community. Thank you for joining us on this important journey!

# Project's Code of Conduct for Users

Every user should familiarize with our project's code of conduct.....

# Important Resources for Contributors
* ReadMe
* Roadmap
* Google forms

# Our Communication Channels: if you are using forums, chat clients, email lists or other ways of communicating about the project, list those here and provide instructions on how to join.
* We primarily communicate via email
* WhatsApp platform

# Tell readers how to submit changes: This is the process for adding your work or changes to the repository or collection of ongoing work (Leave this blank for now– we’ll cover how to manage contributions on the web with an open workflow in the next module.)

# Describe Good First bugs for Contributors: Guidelines for the types of “bugs” or useful, helpful tasks new contributors should start with as they’re first coming on to a project. A bug often refers to a problem that needs to be fixed. These should be small, fairly easy but meaningful tasks that get a new contributor started and provide an early, encouraging success. For a very new project, a good first bug might be to ask contributors to comment on your README file– does it make sense, do they understand the project? Is all the information they need there? Are there any typos?

# Tell readers how to report a bug: Ask your contributors to stay on the lookout for can any potential issue that might cause problems for the project. These could be problems in code (if you’re creating software), content omissions or copy errors (if you’re creating a learning resource), or any issues with the functionality or design of your project. Basically, by asking users to report bugs, you’re asking for feedback on work that’s been done. Most projects invite all contributors to reporttell the project lead about bugs, so “debugging” or fixing problems happens quickly and with the input of the community. Take a look at Atom’s example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project. (Again, you may want to add to this section after you get comfortable with GitHub, and get everything online)

# Tell users about your recognition model - Remember, you need to acknowledge value of the time and work your volunteers give your project. Here, provide a pre-emptive “thank you” for interest contributing. List any recognition contributors might receive for participating in your project. You can also outline how contributors can “level up” to become project maintainers (a certain number of bugs resolved, a certain number of changes or contributions successfully submitted to the project). You can leave this blank for now, and fill it in later.

# Let users know where to go for help - provide clear contact info, and outline the process for getting in touch, for anyone with questions.
